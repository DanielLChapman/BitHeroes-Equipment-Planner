Future

12. Add Stat View Window
13. Allow for person to set TS
14. Add Effects to Equipments / Sets 
15. Update stats by effects
16. Write tests for each set/mythic


1. Add all pets and accessories ✔ (Almost all legendaries besides PVP rewards as those are unrealistic to get. May need to do urgoff and those types of pets differently)
2. Search Functionality to search for certain words in both title and effects
3. Add enchants / runes <- not sure how to save without a database but I guess I would have to add it in
4. Skill calculations
5. Way to get back to the top. Maybe re-do bonuses so it is always visible
